  <title>Mixture Problems</title> 
 
  <introduction> <alert> Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations. </alert> </introduction> 

   <p> 
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mixture problems:
   </p> 
 
<tabular halign="center" top="minor"  left="minor" bottom="minor" right="minor">
  <row>     <cell>  </cell>    <cell> Amount </cell>    <cell>Part</cell>    <cell>Total</cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell> Item <m>1</m> </cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell> Item <m>2</m> </cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell>Final</cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>

      </tabular>

<p>
The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal) in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem and answer the questions.
</p>
<p>
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one variable problems.
</p>

  <example>	
<p>
A chemist has <m>70</m> mL of a <m>50\%</m> methane solution. How much of a <m>80\%</m> solution must she add so the final solution is <m>60\%</m> methane?

     <p> Set up the mixture table. We start with <m>70</m>, but don’t know how much we add, that is <m>x</m>. The part is the percentages, <m>0.5</m> for start, <m>0.8</m> for add.</p>

<p> The same process can be used if the starting and final amount have a price attached to them, 
rather than a percentage.</p>

  <example>	
<p>
A coffee mix is to be made that sells for <m>\$2.50</m> by mixing two types of coffee. The cafe has <m>40</m> mL of coffee that costs <m>\$3.00</m>. How much of another coffee that costs <m>\$1.50</m> should the cafe mix with the first?

The above problems illustrate how we can put the mixture table together and get an equation to solve. However, here we are interested in systems of equations, with two unknown values. The following example is one such problem.
</p>

  <example>	
<p>
A farmer has two types of milk, one that is <m>24\%</m> butterfat and another which is <m>18\%</m> butterfat. How much of each should he use to end up with <m>42</m> gallons of <m>20\%</m> butterfat?

In a candy shop, chocolate which sells for <m>\$4</m> a pound is mixed with nuts which are sold for <m>\$2.50</m> a pound are mixed to form a chocolate-nut candy which sells for <m>\$3.50</m> a pound. How much of each are used to make <m>30</m> pounds of the mixture?

<p>
With mixture problems we often are mixing with a pure solution or using water which contains none of our chemical we are interested in. For pure solutions, the percentage is <m>100\%</m> (or <m>1</m> in the table). For water, the percentage is <m>0\%</m>. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

  <example>	
<p>
A solution of pure antifreeze is mixed with water to make a $65%$ antifreeze solution. How much of each should be sued to make $70$ L?
