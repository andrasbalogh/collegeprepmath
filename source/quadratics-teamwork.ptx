  <title>Quadratics - Teamwork</title> 
 
  <introduction> <alert> Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational equation to model the problem.   </alert> </introduction> 

<p>
If it takes one person <m>4</m> hours to paint a room and another person <m>12</m> hours to paint the same room, working together they could paint the room even quicker, it turns out they would paint the room in <m>3</m> hours together. This can be reasoned by the following logic, if the first person paints the room in <m>4</m> hours, she paints <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of the room each hour. If the second person takes <m>12</m> hours to paint the room, he paints <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint <m>\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{12}</m> of the room. Using a common denominator of <m>12</m> gives: <m>\frac{3}{12}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{3}</m> . This means each hour, working together they complete <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> of the room. If <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> is completed each hour, it follows that it will take <m>3</m> hours to complete the entire room.
</p>

<p>
This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the first person does a job in <m>A</m>, a second person does a job in <m>B</m>, and together they can do a job in <m>T</m> (total). We can use the teamwork equation.
</p>

<me>\text{Teamwork Equation: } \mathbf{\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}=\frac{1}{T}}</me>

<p>
Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than thinking of the first fraction as <m>\frac{1}{A}</m>, it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of <m>A</m>’s time.
</p>


  <p> <alert> World View Note:</alert> When the Egyptians, who were the first to work with fractions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numerator of one). They only used these type of fractions for about <m>2000</m> years! Some believe that this cumbersome style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradition, others believe the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fractions that has been completely lost in history. </p>

  <example>
<p>
Adam can clean a room in <m>3</m> hours. If his sister Maria helps, they can clean it in <m>2\frac{2}{5}</m> hours. How long will it take Maria to do the job alone?
</p>
    <md> 
      <mrow> 2\frac{2}{5}=\frac{12}{5} \amp \quad  \text{Together time, $2\frac{2}{5}$, needs to be converted to fraction}    </mrow> 
      <mrow> \text{Adan: $3$, Maria: $x$, Total: } \frac{5}{12}  \amp\quad  \text{Clearly state times for each and total, using $x$ for Maria} </mrow> 
      <mrow> \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{5}{12} \amp\quad  \text{Using reciprocals, add the individual times gives total}  </mrow> 
      <mrow> \frac{1(12x)}{3}+\frac{1(12x)}{x}=\frac{5(12x)}{12} \amp\quad  \text{Multiply each term by LCD of} 12x  </mrow>

      <mrow> \text{It takes Maria $12$ hours}  \amp\quad  \text{Our Solution}  </mrow> 
    </md>
  </example> 

<p>
Sometimes we only know how two people’s times are related to each other as in the next example.
</p>

  <example>
<p>
Mike takes twice as long as Rachel to complete a project. Together they can complete the project in <m>10</m> hours. How long will it take each of them to complete the project alone?
</p>
    <md> 
      <mrow> \text{Mike: $2x$, Rachel: $x$, Total: $10$} \amp \quad  \text{Clearly define variables. If Rachel is $x$, Mike is } 2x </mrow> 
      <mrow> \frac{1}{2x}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{10} \amp\quad  \text{Using reciprocals, add individual times equaling total} </mrow>  
      <mrow> \frac{1(10x)}{2x}+\frac{1(10x)}{x}=\frac{1(10x)}{10} \amp\quad  \text{Multiply each term by LCD, } 10x   </mrow>

      <mrow> 15=x \amp\quad  \text{We have our $x$, we said $x$ was Rachel’s time}</mrow> 
      <mrow> 2(15)=30 \amp\quad  \text{Mike is double Rachel; this gives Mike’s time. } </mrow> 
      <mrow> \text{Mike: $30$ hr, Rachel: $15$ hr} \amp\quad  \text{Our Solution}  </mrow> 
    </md>
  </example> 

<p>
With problems such as these we will often end up with a quadratic to solve.
</p>

  <example>
<p>
Brittney can build a large shed in <m>10</m> days less than Cosmo can. If they built it together it would take them <m>12</m> days. How long would it take each of them working alone?
</p>
    <md> 
      <mrow> \text{Britney: $x-10$, Cosmo: $x$, Total: $12$} \amp \quad  \text{If Cosmo is $x$, Britney is } x-10 </mrow>

      <mrow> \frac{1(12x(x-10))}{x-10}+\frac{1(12x(x-10))}{x}= \frac{1(12x(x-10))}{12} \amp\quad  \text{Multiply by LCD: } 12x(x-10)   </mrow> 
      <mrow> 12x+12(x-10)=x(x-10) \amp\quad  \text{Reduce fraction } </mrow> 
      <mrow> 12x+12x-120=x^2-10x \amp\quad  \text{Distribute} </mrow> 
      <mrow> 24x-120=x^2-10x \amp\quad  \text{Combine like terms} </mrow> 
      <mrow> \underline{-24x+120 \ -24x+120} \amp\quad  \text{Move all terms to one side} </mrow> 
      <mrow> 0=x^2-34x+120 \amp\quad  \text{Factor} </mrow> 
      <mrow> 0=(x-30)(x-4) \amp\quad  \text{Set each factor equal to zero } </mrow> 
      <mrow> x-30=0 \text{ or } x-4=0 \amp\quad  \text{Solve each equation}</mrow> 
      <mrow> \underline{+30+30} \quad\quad \underline{+4+4} \amp\quad  \text{} </mrow>
      <mrow> x=30 \text{ or } x=4 \amp\quad  \text{This, $x$, was defined as Cosmo.} </mrow>  
      <mrow> 30-10=20 \text{ or } 4-10=-6 \amp\quad  \text{Find Britney, can’t have negative time} </mrow> 
      <mrow> \text{Britney: $20$ days, Cosmo: $30$ days} \amp\quad  \text{Our Solution}  </mrow> 
    </md>
  </example>

<p>
In the previous example, when solving, one of the possible times ended up negative. We can’t have a negative amount of time to build a shed, so this possibility is ignored for this problem. Also, as we were solving, we had to factor <m>x^2 - 34x + 120</m>. This may have been difficult to factor. We could have also chosen to complete the square or use the quadratic formula to find our solutions.
</p>

<p>
It is important that units match as we solve problems. This means we may have to convert minutes into hours to match the other units given in the problem.
</p>

<example>
<p>
An electrician can complete a job in one hour less than his apprentice. Together they do the job in <m>1</m> hour and <m>12</m> minutes. How long would it take each of them working alone?

  <p>
Very similar to a teamwork problem is when the two involved parts are working against each other. A common example of this is a sink that is filled by a pipe and emptied by a drain. If they are working against each other we need to make one of the values negative to show they oppose each other. This is shown in the next example.
</p>


  <example>
<p>
A sink can be filled by a pipe in <m>5</m> minutes but it takes <m>7</m> minutes to drain a full sink. If both the pipe and the drain are open, how long will it take to fill the sink?
</p>

      <mrow> \frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}=\frac{1}{x} \amp\quad  \begin{array}{l} \text{Using reciprocals to make equation,}\\ \text{subtract because they are opposite.} \end{array}</mrow>  
      <mrow> \frac{1(35x)}{5}-\frac{1(35x)}{7}=\frac{1(35x)}{x} \amp\quad  \text{Multiply each term by LCD: } 35x   </mrow>
