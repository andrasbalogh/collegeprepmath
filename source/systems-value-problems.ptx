  <title>Value Problems</title>
 
  <introduction> <alert> Objective: Solve value problems by setting up a system of equations. </alert> </introduction>

   <p>
 One application of system of equations are known as value problems. 
 Value problems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. 
 For example, if our variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, 
 those nickles would have a value of five cents each. We will use a table to help us 
 set up and solve value problems. The basic structure of the table is shown below.
   </p>
 <p>
<tabular halign="center" top="minor"  left="minor" bottom="minor" right="minor">
  <row>     <cell>  </cell>    <cell> Number </cell>    <cell>Value</cell>    <cell>Total</cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell> Item <m>1</m> </cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell> Item <m>2</m> </cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>
  <row>     <cell>Total</cell>    <cell> </cell>    <cell></cell>    <cell></cell>      </row>
      </tabular>
</p>
 
<p>
The first column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have <m>7</m> dimes, each with a value of <m>10</m> cents, the total value is <m>7 · 10 = 70</m> cents. The last row of the table is for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it. Once the table is filled in we can easily make equations by adding each column, setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

  <example>
<p>
In a child’s bank are <m>11</m> coins that have a value of <m>\$ 1.85</m>. The coins are either quarters or dimes. How many coins each does the child have?

</example>

<p> <alert> World View Note: </alert> American coins are the only coins that do not state the value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not <m>10</m> cents). On the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not <m>25</m> cents). On the penny it says “one cent” (not <m>1</m> cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily use the coins. </p>

<p>
Ticket sales also have a value. Often different types of tickets sell for different prices (values). These problems can be solve in much the same way.
</p>


  <example>
<p>
There were <m>41</m> tickets sold for an event. 
Tickets for children cost <m>\$ 1.50</m> and tickets for adults cost <m>\$2.00</m>. 
Total receipts for the event were <m>\$73.50</m>. How many of each type of ticket were sold?

Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to multiply one variable by <m>2</m>, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by <m>2</m>. Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the equation would be <m>d=2n</m>. This type of problem is in the next example.
</p>
 
  <example>
<p>
A man has a collection of stamps made up of <m>5</m> cent stamps and <m>8</m> cent stamps. There are three times as many <m>8</m> cent stamps as <m>5</m> cent stamps. The total value of all the stamps is <m>\$3.48</m>. How many of each stamp does he have?

The same process for solving value problems can be applied to solving interest problems. Our table titles will be adjusted slightly as we do so.
  </p>

  <row>     <cell>  </cell>    <cell> Invest </cell>    <cell>Rate</cell>    <cell>Interest</cell>      </row>

<p>
Our first column is for the amount invested in each account. The second column is the interest rate earned (written as a decimal - move decimal point twice left), and the last column is for the amount of interest earned. Just as before, we multiply the investment amount by the rate to find the final column, the interest earned. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

  <example>
<p>
A woman invests <m>\$4000</m> in two accounts, one at <m>6\%</m> interest, the other at <m>9\%</m> interest for one year. At the end of the year she had earned <m>\$270</m> in interest. How much did she have invested in each account?
