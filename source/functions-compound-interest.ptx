  <title> Compound Interest </title> 
 
  <introduction> <alert> Objective: Calculate final account balances using the formulas for 
  compound and continuous interest. </alert> </introduction> 
 
   <p> 
An application of exponential functions is compound interest. When money is invested in an 
account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the balance. This money added to 
the balance is called interest. Once that interest is added to the balance, it will earn 
more interest during the next compounding period. This idea of earning interest on interest 
is called compound interest. For example, if you invest <m>\$100</m> at <m>10\%</m>  
interest compounded annually, after one year you will earn <m>\$10</m> in interest, 
giving you a new balance of <m>\$110</m>. The next year you will earn another <m>10\%</m> 
or <m>\$11</m>, giving you a new balance of <m>\$121</m>. The third year you will earn another 
<m>10\%</m> or <m>\$12.10</m>, giving you a new balance of <m>\$133.10</m>. 
This pattern will continue each year until you close the account.
   </p> 

<p>
There are several ways interest can be paid. The first way, as described above, is compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But interest can be compounded more often. Some common compounds include compounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four times per year, such as quarterly taxes), monthly (<m>12</m> times per year, such as a savings account), weekly (<m>52</m> times per year), or even daily (<m>365</m> times per year, such as some student loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways, we can calculate the balance after any amount of time using the following formula:
</p>
 
<me>\textbf{Compount Interest Formula: } \mathbf{ A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt},} </me>
<me> A= \text{Final Amount} </me>
<me> P= \text{Principle (starting balance)} </me>
<me> r= \text{Interest rate (as a decimal)} </me>
<me> n=\text{number of compounds per year} </me>
<me> t= \text{time (in years)} </me>

  <example>
<p> If you take a car loan for <m>\$25000</m> with an interest rate of <m>6.5\%</m> compounded quarterly, no payments required for the first five years, what will your balance be at the end of those five years? </p>

We can also find a missing part of the equation by using our techniques for solving equations.

<p>
It is interesting to compare equal investments that are made at several different types of 
compounds. The next few examples do just that.
</p>

<example>
<p>
If <m>\$4,000</m> is invested in an account paying <m>3\%</m> interest compounded monthly, what is the balance after <m>7</m> years?
</p> 
    <md>

      <mrow> \$4,933.42 \amp\quad  \text{ Our Solution  }  </mrow>
    </md>
  </example> 

<p>
To investigate what happens to the balance if the compounds happen more often, 
we will consider the same problem, this time with interest compounded daily.
</p>

<example>
<p>
If <m>\$4,000</m> is invested in an account paying <m>3\%</m> interest compounded daily, 
what is the balance after <m>7</m> years?
</p>
    <md> 
      <mrow> P=4000, r=0.03, n=365, t=7 \amp \quad  \text{ Identify each variable }   </mrow> 
      <mrow> A=4000\left(1+\frac{0.03}{365}\right)^{365 \cdot 7} \amp\quad  \text{ Plug each value into formula,  evaluate parenthesis }  </mrow> 
      <mrow> A=4000(1.00008219)^{365 \cdot 7} \amp\quad  \text{ Multiply exponents }  </mrow> 
      <mrow> A=4000(1.00008219)^{2555}  \amp\quad  \text{ Evaluate exponent }  </mrow> 
      <mrow> A=4000(1.23366741) \amp\quad  \text{ Multiply } </mrow> 
      <mrow> A=4934.67 \amp\quad  \text{ }   </mrow>
      <mrow> \$4,934.67 \amp\quad  \text{ Our Solution  }  </mrow>

    </md>
  </example> 

<p>
While this difference is not very large, it is a bit higher. 
The table below shows the result for the same problem with different compounds.
</p>

<p>
As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compounded, the higher the final balance 
will be. The reason is because we are calculating compound interest or interest on interest. 
So once interest is paid into the account it will start earning interest for the next compound 
and thus giving a higher final balance. The next question one might consider is what is the 
maximum number of compounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interest compounded 
an infinite number of times a year. This is when the interest is compounded continuously. 
When we see the word “continuously” we will know that we cannot use the first formula. 
Instead we will use the following formula:
</p>

<me>\textbf{Interest Compounded Continuously: } \mathbf{ A=Pe^{rt}} </me>
<me> A= \text{Final Amount} </me>
<me> P= \text{Principle (starting balance)} </me>
<me> e= \text{a constant approximately $2.71828183…$} </me>
<me> r=\text{Interest rate (written as a decimal)} </me>
<me> t= \text{time (years)} </me>

<p>
The variable <m>e</m> is a constant similar in idea to pi (<m>\pi</m>) in that it goes on forever without repeat or pattern, but just as pi (<m>\pi</m>) naturally occurs in several geometry applications, so does <m>e</m> appear in many exponential applications, continuous interest being one of them. If you have a scientific calculator you probably have an <m>e</m> button (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit <m>\ln</m>) that will be useful in calculating interest compounded continuously.
</p>

<p> <alert> World View Note: </alert> <m>e</m> first appeared in <m>1618</m> in 
Scottish mathematician’s Napier’s work on logarithms. However, it was Euler in Switzerland 
who used the letter <m>e</m> first to represent this value. Some say he used e because his 
name begins with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with <m>e</m>. 
Others say it is because Euler’s work already had the letter <m>a</m> in use, so <m>e</m> 
would be the next value. Whatever the reason, ever since he used it in <m>1731</m>, <m>e</m> 
became the natural base.  </p>

<example>
<p>
If <m>\$4,000</m> is invested in an account paying <m>3\%</m> interest compounded continuously, 
what is the balance after <m>7</m> years?

<p>
Albert Einstein once said that the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest. 
Consider the following example, illustrating how powerful compound interest can be.
</p>

<example>
<p>
If you invest <m>\$6.16</m> in an account paying <m>12\%</m> interest compounded continuously for <m>100</m> years, and that is all you have to leave your children as an inheritance, what will the final balance be that they will receive?

<p>
In <m>100</m> years that one-time investment of <m>\$6.16</m> 
grew to over one million dollars! That’s the power of compound interest!
