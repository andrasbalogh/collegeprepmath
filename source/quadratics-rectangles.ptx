  <introduction> <alert> Objective:Solve applications of quadratic equations using rectangles.</alert> </introduction> 

  <p>  An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will first draw a picture to represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation. </p>

The above rectangle problem is very simple as there is only one rectangle involved. When we compare two rectangles, we may have to get a bit more creative.

<p>
From one rectangle we can find two equations. Perimeter is found by adding all the sides of a polygon together. A rectangle has two widths and two lengths, both the same size. So we can use the equation <m>P = 2l + 2w</m> (twice the length plus twice the width).
</p>

<example>
<p>
The area of a rectangle is <m>168 \ {\rm cm}^2</m>. The perimeter of the same rectangle is <m>52 \ {\rm cm}</m>. What are the dimensions of the rectangle?

Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “frame problem”. The idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a photograph, is centered inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases, it will be important to remember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectangle. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

<example>
<p>
An <m>8</m> in by <m>12</m> in picture has a frame of uniform width around it. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the picture. What is the width of the frame?

For each of the frame problems above we could have also completed the square or use the quadratic formula to solve the trinomials. Remember that completing the square or the quadratic formula always will work when solving, however, factoring only works if we can factor the trinomial.
