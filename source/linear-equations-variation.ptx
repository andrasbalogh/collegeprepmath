<title>Variation </title>
<introduction> <alert> Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and finding the variation constant. </alert> </introduction>

<p>
One application of solving linear equations is variation. 
Often different events are related by what is called the constant of variation. 
For example, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are 
traveling. The faster you travel, the less time it takes to get there. 
This is one type of variation problem. We will look at three types of variation here. 
Variation problems have two or three variables and a constant in them. 
The constant, usually noted with a <m>k</m>, describes the relationship and does not change 
as the other variables in the problem change. 
There are two ways to set up a variation problem, 
the first solves for one of the variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. 
Here we will use the second method.
</p>

<p>
The Greek letter pi (<m>\pi</m>) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle 
to its diameter.
</p>

<p>
<alert> World View Note:</alert> In the <m>5</m>th century, Chinese mathematician 
Zu Chongzhi calculated the value of <m>\pi</m> to seven decimal places (<m>3.1415926</m>). 
This was the most accurate value of <m>\pi</m> for the next <m>1000</m> years!
</p>

<p>
If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter you will 
always get the same value, about <m>3.14159</m>. 
If you have a bigger circumference you will also have a bigger diameter. 
This relationship is called <alert>direct variation</alert> or 
<alert>directly proportional</alert>. If we see this phrase in the problem, 
we know to divide to find the constant of variation.
</p>

<example>
    <md>
    <mrow> m \text{ varies directly as } n \amp \quad \text{“Directly” tells us to divide} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{m}{n}=k \amp\quad \text{Our formula for the relationship} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. 
If you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board, 
you will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, 
which means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. 
This relationship is called <alert>indirect variation</alert> or 
<alert>inversely proportional</alert>. If we see this phrase in the problem, 
we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.
</p>

<example>
    <md>
    <mrow> y \text{ is inversely proportional to } z \amp \quad \text{“Inversely” tells us to multiply} </mrow>
    <mrow> yz=k \amp\quad \text{Our formula for the relationship} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. 
If we divide the area by the base times the height, 
we will also get a constant, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. 
This relationship is called <alert>joint variation</alert> or
 <alert>jointly proportional</alert>. 
 If we see this phrase in the problem, we know to divide the first variable 
 by the product of the other two to find the constant of variation.
</p>

<example>
    <md>
    <mrow> A \text{ varies jointly as $x$ and $y$} \amp \quad \text{“Jointly” tells us to divide by the product} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{A}{xy} =k \amp \quad \text{Our formula for the relationship} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation problem, 
we use given or known information to calculate the constant of variation. 
This is shown for each type of variation in the next three examples.
</p>

<example>
    <me> w \text{ is directly proportional to $y$ and $w = 50$ when $y=5$} </me>
    <md>
    <mrow> \frac{w}{y}=k \amp \quad \text{“Directly” tells us to divide} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(50)}{(5)}=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values} </mrow>
    <mrow> 10=k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<example>
    <me> c \text{  varies indirectly as $d$ and $c = 4.5$ when $d=6$} </me>
    <md>
    <mrow> cd=k \amp \quad \text{“Indirectly” tells us to multiply} </mrow>
    <mrow> (4.5)(6)=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values} </mrow>
    <mrow> 27=k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<example>
    <me> x \text{ is jointly proportional to $y$ and $z$ and $x = 48$ when $y=2$ and $z=4$} </me>
    <md>
    <mrow> \frac{x}{yz}=k \amp \quad \text{“Jointly” tells us to divide the product} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(48)}{(2)(4)}=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values} </mrow>
    <mrow> 6=k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
Once we have found the constant of variation, we can use it to find other combinations 
in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three important steps, 
none of which should be skipped.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation </p></li>
<li><p> Find the constant of variation using known values </p></li>
<li><p> Answer the question using the constant of variation </p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The next three examples show how this process is worked out for each type of variation.
</p>

<example>
    <p> The price of an item varies directly with the sales tax. If a $<m>25</m> 
    item has a sales tax of $<m>2</m>, what will the tax be on a $<m>40</m> item? </p>
    <md>
    <mrow> \frac{p}{t}=k \amp \quad \text{“Directly” tells us to divide price ($p$) and tax ($t$)} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(25)}{(2)}=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values for price and tax} </mrow>
    <mrow> 12.5=k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{40}{t}=12.5 \amp \quad \text{Using our constant, substitute $40$ for price to find the tax} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(t)40}{t}=12.5 (t) \amp \quad \text{Multiply by LCD$=t$ to clear fraction} </mrow>
    <mrow> 40=12.5t \amp \quad \text{Reduce the $t$ with the denominator} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{40}{12.5}=\frac{12.5t}{12.5} \amp \quad \text{Divide by 12.5} </mrow>
    <mrow> 3.2 = t \amp \quad \text{Our solution: Tax is \$$3.20$} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<example>
    <p> The speed (or rate) Josiah travels to work is inversely proportional to time it takes 
    to get there. If he travels <m>35</m> miles per hour it will take him <m>2.5</m> hours 
    to get to work. How long will it take him if he travels <m>55</m> miles per hour? </p>
    <md>
    <mrow> rt=k \amp \quad \text{“Inversely” tells us to multiply the rate and time} </mrow>
    <mrow> (35)(2.5)=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values for rate and time} </mrow>
    <mrow> 87.5=k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    <mrow> 55t=87.5 \amp \quad \text{Using our constant, substitute $55$ for rate to find the time} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{55t}{55}=\frac{87.5}{55} \amp \quad \text{Divide both sides by $55$} </mrow>
    <mrow> t \approx 1.59 \amp \quad \text{Our solution: It takes him $1.59$ hours to get to work} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<example>
    <p> The amount of simple interest earned on an investment varies jointly as the principle 
    (amount invested) and the time it is invested. In an account, $<m>150</m> invested 
    for <m>2</m> years earned $<m>12</m> in interest. 
    How much interest would be earned on a $<m>220</m> investment for <m>3</m> years? </p>
    <md>
    <mrow> \frac{I}{Pt}=k \amp \quad \text{“Jointly” divide Interest ($I$) by product of Principle ($P$) and time ($t$)} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(12)}{(150)(2)}=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values for Interest, Principle and time} </mrow>
    <mrow> 0.04 =k \amp \quad \text{Evaluate to find our constant} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{I}{(220)(3)} =0.04 \amp \quad \text{Using constant, substitute $220$ for principle and $3$ for time} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{I}{660}=0.04 \amp \quad \text{Evaluate denominator} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(660)I}{660}=0.04 (660) \amp \quad \text{Multiply by $660$ to isolate the variable} </mrow>
    <mrow> I=26.4 \amp \quad \text{Our Solution: The investment earned \$$26.40$ in interest} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set up 
the formula for the relationship. For example, <m>\pi</m> can be thought of as the ratio 
of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct variation; we say the area varies 
directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our formula. 
This is shown in the next example.
</p>

<example>
    <p> The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. 
    A circle with a radius of <m>10</m> has an area of <m>314</m>. 
    What will the area be on a circle of radius <m>4</m>? </p>
    <md>
    <mrow> \frac{A}{r^2}=k \amp \quad \text{"Direct" tells us to divide, be sure we use $r^2$ for the denominator} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(314)}{(10)^2}=k \amp \quad \text{Substitute known values into our formula} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(314)}{100}=k \amp \quad \text{Exponents first} </mrow>
    <mrow> 3.14 =k \amp \quad \text{Divide to find our constant} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{A}{(4)^2}=3.14 \amp \quad \text{Using the constant, use $4$ for $r$, don't forget the squared!} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{A}{16}=3.14 \amp \quad \text{Evaluate the exponent} </mrow>
    <mrow> \frac{(16)A}{16}=3.14 (16) \amp \quad \text{Multiply both sides by $16$} </mrow>
    <mrow> A=50.4 \amp \quad \text{Our Solution: Area is $50.24$} </mrow>
    </md>
</example>

<p>
  When solving variation problems, it is important to take the time to clearly state
  the variation formula, find the constant, and solve the final equation.
